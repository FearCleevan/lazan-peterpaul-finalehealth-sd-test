# Patient & Visit Management System - Technical Assessment

## Submission Notes
I've completed the frontend implementation using Angular with all required functionality, including:
- Patient list with search, pagination, and filtering
- Add/Edit Patient forms with validation
- Visit management (list, add/edit) per patient
- Summary views
- Proper state management with RxJS
- Clean folder structure

**Note**: Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to complete the backend implementation with NestJS and MongoDB integration. The frontend is fully functional with mock data services that simulate API calls.

## Running the Project
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Access the application at: `http://localhost:4200/`
